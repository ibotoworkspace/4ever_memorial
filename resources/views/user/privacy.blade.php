                                IBOTO EMPIRE ( Ibotoempire) values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will
                                help you understand how we collect

                                facilities and services, and what we
                                will and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and
                                created to assure those affiliated with
                                IBOTO EMPIRE of our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to
                                exceed, most existing privacy

                                We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you have not

                                sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this
                                page. If you are a registered user,
                                we will notify you via email of any changes or updates made to this Policy. If at any point
                                in time IBOTO EMPIRE decides to
                                make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different
                                from that which was stated when this

                                Users at that time shall have the
                                option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner.

                                In addition to the rights above, please rest assured that we will always aim to encrypt and
                                anonymize your personal
                                information whenever possible. We also have protocols in place in the unlikely event that we
                                suffer a data breach and we will
                                contact you if your personal information is ever at risk. For more details regarding our
                                security protections see the section

                                IBOTO EMPIRE takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
                                information via the website, your
                                information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information
                                (e.g. credit card information), that
                                information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by
                                looking for a lock icon in the address bar
                                and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect
                                your information offline. Only
                                employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or
                                customer service) are granted access to
                                personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally
                                identifiable information are kept in
                                a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
                                disclosure or modification of the
                                user's personal information under our control.

                                The Company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private
                                communications to build users' trust and
                                confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and
                                communication of credit card and
                                personal information.
