                                    December 11, 2022. He will be with us forever, and we will never stop loving him. I
                                    decided to start this website to celebrate his life. Even though he wasn't with us
                                    as long as he should've been, he has touched so many lives and was so loved. I hope
                                    you all will contribute to this page, with picture, videos, and stories. I was so
                                    touched by all the memories left in the memory jar at the luncheon. Please feel free
                                    to add more, as they may come to you, because that's all we have left once a loved
                                    one leaves us. We all appreciate the love you showed Anthony for however long you
                                    may have known him. Thank you all!

                                                <p>Anthony was always precocious and asked every question ever. I loved
                                                    his need to know more and more and to question. He always made me
                                                    laugh. My favorite memories are long conversations with him. He
                                                    could talk. And was so interesting. He was sweet and generous to
                                                    everyone. He loved being in charge of projects and got any job done
                                                    always wanting to do more. I miss his voice and laugh and " yo, Mrs
                                                    Johnson! You vibing?" Anthony you will remain in my heart forever.

                                                (aka
                                                gossip haha.) We shared so many nice chats here and always wanted to
                                                reserve
                                                a study room but we were always too lazy to do that. We'd find an empty
                                                one
                                                but then get kicked out like 10 minutes later after someone who actually
                                                reserved it came in. All the memories at school hold a special place in
                                                my
                                                heart. I walk past the places we would hang out and think about
                                                everything.
                                                I am glad we went from high school to college. I am so grateful I got to
